# Docker
Here, I post my personal projects on docker.

Pre-reqs : 

1. You should have persnal machine (Virtual or physical) with basic system requirements. In case you are poor like me, you can use AWS/Azure/GCP free tier account and use the free instance. That should get you started.
 
2. Install docker on your machine using the guide provided in notes.

3. Thank Solomon Hykes for creating such cool tech.
