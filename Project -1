Aim : 

1. We will install apache web server on an ec2 install in AWS free tier account. 
2. We will also host a dummy website on same apache2 webserver.
3. All of this will happen in the most light weighted manner using docker.


========================================================================================================================================================================
Procedure :


1. Since, we have already installed docker on our ec2 instance using the Install Docker file. We will directly jump to writing a docker file.
2. Before, that lets check if docker is properly install docker using below two commands

which docker ------------------------------> will tell where this app is installed
sudo systemctl status docker --------------> will tell the status of docker service

3. Now, lets move towards writing our first docker file.

sudo nano Dockerfile ---------------------> will create a text editor with a file named Dockerfile (It is a standard file and must not be changed)

4. Write following code in Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest -----------------------> will use a ubuntu base image with tag "latest" from docker hub ( docker repository for images )

RUN apt-get update -y --------------------> will update fetch all the latest package information from configure resources

RUN apt-get install apache2 -y ----------> will install apache2 web server on ubuntu machine , -y tag will assist in non interative installation

COPY . /var/www/html --------------------> will copy all the files (use dummy files provided in repo) from current directory to /var/www/html directory in container

EXPOSE 80 -------------------------------> will expose port 80 of the container, so we can access the website

CMD ["apache2ctl" , "-D" , "FOREGROUND"] -> will run the apache server in foreground

" Now ,just save and exit from the file."


5. Awesome, we are half way there. great job !! .

6. Now, come back to the ec2 cli and run below command to create a docker image from Dockerfile we just created. As docker file is just a blueprint of how our docker image would be.

sudo docker build -t webserver1 . -----> will build a docker image using file with tag : webserver1 . Since Dockerfile is in same directory hence, we use "." else use the absolute path.

7. Now, lets check if the image got built or not by using below command.

sudo docker images -------------------> will show all the local images

8. Now, run below command to deploy a container with our "webserver" image

sudo docker run -d --name webserver -p 80:80 webserver --> it will run a container "webserver" in detached mode (-d tag) with port 80 mapped with the port 80 of ec2 instance (-p tag)

9. Since we have to access the container using ec2 instance's ip address, we have to map the port to instance.

10. And we are done, try to open the instance's public ip address on port 80. You will be able to see our dummy website.


============================================================================================================================================================================

Result : We are able to render the website using instance's ip address on port 80.
